description: '"My grace is sufficient for thee" (2 Corinthians 12:9). Before Pilgrim''s
  Progress, John Bunyan wrote Grace Abounding-from his jail cell. John was not imprisoned
  for his youthful rebellion, but for preaching the gospel after he heard a word from
  God."For though, as yet, I was nothing but a poor painted hypocrite, yet I loved
  to be talked of as one that was truly godly."For many years, John-like all Christians-struggled
  with his sinful nature. In Grace Abounding, he honestly declares his shortcomings,
  and knows that he must overcome them to fulfill his destiny."'
